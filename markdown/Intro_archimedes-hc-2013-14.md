## The Archimedes Project at Holy Cross, 2013-14

We will create editions of Archimedes' *On the Sphere and Cylinder* in Codex C and Codex Bodmer 8, as well as an edition of Eutocius's Commentary on *Sphere and Cylinder* preserved in Codex Bodmer 8.

We thank the [Digital Archimedes Palimpsest](http://archimedespalimpsest.net/) for providing digital access to Codex C as preserved in the Archimedes Palimpsest.  We also thank [e-codices](http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/), the Virtual Manuscript Library of Switzerland, for providing digital access to Codex Bodmer 8.
