## The Manuscripts

### Codex C

Codex C is a tenth century AD Byzantine codex which contained a collection of works by Archimedes.  It survives today in the form of the Archimedes Palimpsest: in the thirteenth century the codex was unbound, its folios scraped clean, and the parchment recycled to become part of a prayer book.

At the start of the twentieth century the palimpsested text was identified by John Ludwig Heiberg as works by Archimedes.  He studied and photographed the manuscript, but afterwards the palimpsest was lost.  It reappeared in 1998 in Christie's Auctions from a private French collection.  The anonymous donor who purchased the Archimedes Palimpsest chose to make the work accessible to the public through online, high-resolution digital photography.<sup>1</sup>

The works from Codex C which are preserved in the Archimedes Palimpsest are as follows:

+ *On the Equilibrium of Planes II*
+ *On Floating Bodies I*
+ *On Floating Bodies II*
+ *The Method of Mechanical Theorems*
+ *On Spiral Lines*
+ *On the Sphere and Cylinder I*
+ *On the Sphere and Cylinder II*
+ *On the Measurement of the Circle*
+ *The Stomachion*
