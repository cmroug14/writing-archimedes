## Notebook

### 11/17/13
Added diagram tracings: currently have 58v, 61r, 62v.  Determined a method to preserve geometric data and construction data in the same image file.

#### To Do:
- Change Heiberg photography to match other dimensions

### 11/14/13
Work on diagrams.

#### To Do:
- Note where polygons are drawn with curved lines and where with straight lines: both seem to be present.

### 11/8/13
Imaged postulates 0-3 and marked up hard copy of text.  Planned for presentation.

### 11/1/13
Imaged axiom six and marked up hard copy of the text for axiom 5 and lemmata 8.  Began lemmata 9 (finished first image).

### 10/25/13
Imaged the first five axioms of *Sphere and Cylinder* and marked up the hard copy of the text.

Marked up the hard copy of the text for lemmata 8 (through first two imaged sections).

### 10/11/13
Imaged the preface of *Sphere and Cylinder* and marked up the hard copy of the text for the preface.

### 10/8/13
Moved text-to-image data from Fusion document to two files in the repository.  Edited wiki guide to reflect the new location and work process.

### 10/4/13
Continued work on the Google Fusion document in one team. Team 2 went up through folio 63r and encountered numerous gaps in the text.

#### To Do:
- ~~Create two .csv files in the repository (one for each team) from this Google document~~
- Bring in translations of *Sphere and Cylinder* to reference during future weeks


### 9/27/13
Began work on a Google Fusion document which relates sections of *On the Sphere and Cylinder* (lemmata, propositions, axioms, etc.) to image citations for their locations in the palimpsest.

*Sphere and Cylinder* Books I and II have been divided in two for this project so that two teams might approach the process at the same time.  One team will start next week from the beginning of the treatise on 45r, while the second started this week at 55r.

Team 2 progressed from 55r to 57r today.  Team 2 also discovered a gap between the reconstructed folios 56v and 57r: the text cuts off midway through lemmata 11 and only picks up again midway through corollary 1.

When this project is completed for *Sphere and Cylinder*, the table will be downloaded from Google Fusion and pushed to the repository.

#### To Do:
- ~~Determine how best to represent the gap between 56v and 57r~~
- ~~Add links to the Image Citation Tool for each folio for easy access by all team members~~
- Perhaps photocopy pages from the Archimedes Palimpsest Vol II so that both teams can consult it at the same time with more ease?
