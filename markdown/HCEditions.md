## Our Editions

At Holy Cross, we will create editions that are diplomatic, digital, complete, and open.

### Diplomatic

The Archimedes Project at Holy Cross will produce diplomatic transcriptions of *Sphere and Cylinder* as written in Codex C and preserved today in the Archimedes Palimpsest, *Sphere and Cylinder* as preserved in Codex Bodmer 8, and Commentary on *Sphere and Cylinder* as preserved in Codex Bodmer 8.

Diplomatic is a term which is familiar from print editions.  It has different goals from a critical edition: where a critical edition seeks to publish the 'best' text (usually the 'original' text as written by its author), a diplomatic edition seeks to publish a transcription of precisely what a single manuscript contains.  This includes material ranging from lengthy alternate readings to differences in punctuation or accentuation.

Diplomatic editions can serve as a way to become familiar with the material in a manuscript even if the manuscript itself is inaccessible. 

### Digital

The project's transcriptions will be digital: they will be machine-readable and machine-actionable Greek.  The project uses TEI-compliant XML to transcribe and annotate the text.  The Text Encoding Initiative's standards allow the text to be marked up semantically.

Digital editions create datasets out of these texts.  For instance, the Archimedes Project at Holy Cross is examining *Sphere and Cylinder* in two manuscripts: digital, diplomatic texts allow for automatic comparison between the two.

A digital format possesses several advantages in the creation of a diplomatic edition.  Firstly, it takes advantage of the past initiatives to digitize the Archimedes Palimpsest and Codex Bodmer 8.  High resolution digital photographs are online, licensed to be freely accessible and reusable.  Holy Cross's digital editions can link to those images or include them alongside their texts so that the evidence for the diplomatic transcriptions is available to the reader.

Secondly, a digital format allows more freedom to encode and represent the structure of the text.  Data such as the fact that a certain stretch of text appears on a certain folio, or that certain folios compose a certain quire, can all be encoded in the digital edition.  This data can be incorporated into a website, for instance, where the reader might choose between navigating the text by physical folio or doing so by section of text.

Thirdly, a digital format offers methods to represent the links between texts.  This is valuable when considering the Commentary on *Sphere and Cylinder* alongside the treatise itself.  Certain sections of Eutocius's commentary comment on specific sections of the Archimedes text.  These links can be encoded in the digital edition; in a website presenting the digital edition, the reader can be linked directly to connected material.

The digital nature of these editions also makes the below features of this project possible.

### Complete

The Archimedes Project at Holy Cross uses the total editing approach of the Homer Multitext project.  This approach encompasses the project's goal of modeling the structure of the text, as discussed above.  Furthermore, this goes beyond stating that a certain stretch of text appears on a certain folio: the Archimedes Project cites the location on a folio that a section of text appears on.  This is useful especially in the Archimedes Palimpsest, where the heavily-obscured text appears in two columns on each folio.

The total editing approach also allows features beyond the text to be included in a complete edition.  The most notable example in Archimedes and Eutocius are the diagrams: an image of each diagram (or space left for one that was never drawn in) is captured, and its location on the folio cited.  The same holds true for other marks on the folio, including illuminated letters starting certain sections, marginal numerals numbering each proposition, and symbols appearing on certain lines.

### Open

The Archimedes Project at Holy Cross intends to create editions that are accessible with data that is reusable.  The digital format makes this possible: the editions can be put online, reachable by anyone with an internet connection.  The data (texts, images, etc.) can be downloaded and manipulated by anyone interested.  Just as online images made the Archimedes Palimpsest and Codex Bodmer 8 accessible, the Archimedes Project must make its data and edition freely accessible and freely reusable.  The editions and scholarship produced by the project must not be hidden behind a paywall, but rather be open data.  By making the data available and freely licensed, the Archimedes Project will encourage further scholarship.
