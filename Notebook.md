Began work on a Google Fusion document which relates sections of *On the Sphere and Cylinder* (lemmata, propositions, axioms, etc.) to image citations for their locations in the palimpsest.

*Sphere and Cylinder* Books I and II have been divided in two for this project so that two teams might approach the process at the same time.  One team will start next week from the beginning of the treatise on 45r, while the second started this week at 55r.

Team 2 progressed from 55r to 57r today.  Team 2 also discovered a gap between the reconstructed folios 56v and 57r: the text cuts off midway through lemmata 11 and only picks up again midway through corollary 1.

When this project is completed for *Sphere and Cylinder*, the table will be downloaded from Google Fusion and pushed to the repository.

#### To Do:
- Determine how best to represent the gap between 56v and 57r
- Add links to the Image Citation Tool for each folio for easy access by all team members
- Perhaps photocopy pages from the Archimedes Palimpsest Vol II so that both teams can consult it at the same time with more ease?
